ARIMA and SEASONAL ARIMA

ARIMA models provide another approach to time series forecasting. Exponential smoothing and ARIMA models are the two most widely used approaches to time series forecasting, and provide complementary approaches to the problem. While exponential smoothing models are based on a description of the trend and seasonality in the data, ARIMA models aim to describe the autocorrelations in the data.

## forcasting

Forecasting is required in many situations: deciding whether to build another power generation plant in the next five years requires forecasts of future demand; scheduling staff in a call centre next week requires forecasts of call volumes; stocking an inventory requires forecasts of stock requirements. Forecasts can be required several years in advance (for the case of capital investments), or only a few minutes beforehand (for telecommunication routing). Whatever the circumstances or time horizons involved, forecasting is an important aid to effective and efficient planning.

## Monthly Sales of French Champagne - Perrin Freres

The goal of this project is to forecast the number of monthly sales of champagne for the Perrin Freres label brand. The dataset has 10 years monthly sales of Champagne with 105 observations.



## note 
This is not end to end project in this project we only understand the time series data and how to deal with this type of data using ARIMA and SEASONAL ARIMA.
